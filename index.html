        <div class="biodata">The Timline of HTML 1991- Tim Berners-Lee invents HTML 1.0 1993- HTML 1.0 is released. Not many developers are creating websites at this time. 1995- HTML 2.0 is published. This contains the features of HTML 1.0 plus new features. This remained the standard markup language for designing and creating websites until 1997. 1997- HTML 3.0 was invented. Here, Dave Raggett introduced a fresh draft on HTML, which improved new features of HTML and gave more powerful characteristics for webmasters in designing websites. Unfortunately, the powerful features slowed down the browser in applying further improvements. 1999- The widely-used HTML 4.0 comes out. It is very successful. 2014- HTML 5.0 is released and used worldwide. It is said to be the extended version of HTML 4.01 which was published in 2012.This is where HTML comes in. HTML uses special tags, which are typed in around your text to tell the web browser how to display that text. Similarly, you can do this with images, audio, and video. Having said that, there are some wysiwyg editors for HTML/CSS, such as Wix and Weebly, which take the coding out of making a website. These are great for basic layouts, but if you want the freedom to craft a custom-made magnum opus, the likes of which the world has never seen, you need to learn how to code. If that sounds exciting, there’s another very special feature of HTML – one that changed the very way we live our lives.</div>
